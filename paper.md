# Open Data Cube

## Introduction
Introduction to what the Open Data Cube is, and the problem it is designed to solve (e.g. challenge of rapidly growing volumes of open earth observation data)

---

## Methods
Detailed description of the Open Data Cube model and technical implementation (ideally generic to ODC as a whole, not specific implementations, e.g. DEA)

---

## Results / Applications 
Examples of how Open Data Cube has been instrumental for addressing real-world scientific and management problems.
Could be structured around individual national or transnational implementations (e.g. below) or structured thematically around themes like "Inland water", "Sea, ocean and coastline", "Land and vegetation" etc.

Examples from:

* Digital Earth Australia
* NASA / CEOS
* DEAfrica
* Swiss Data Cube
* Colombian Data Cube
* Mexican Data Cube

---

## Discussion
Critically evaluate ODC's place in the broader earth observation/multidimensional data management ecosystem.

#### Comparison to existing "data cubes"
* Google Earth Engine
* PANGEO

#### Challenges and future work
Base this on ideas for [ODC version 2.0](https://github.com/opendatacube/datacube-core/projects/2)?
Shift from supercomputing implementations to the cloud
